# TidyYup - Clothing Usage Tracker /  Garment Recylying 
TidyYup is an garment tracking application with the objective of recyclying unused clothing. It accomplishes this by storing and updating information onto NFC stickers that contain useage data on a specific piece of clothing. Then proceeds to catorgize clothes into most used and least used list and reccomending near donation centers to send unused clothes to.

# Features
## Garment Tracking System:
A list of shirts and pants that keeps a counter on each article of clothing of how many times you wear it by tracking the scans of the hanger. It puts the least worn clothes at the top of the “least used” list allowing the user to find clothes they haven’t used and donate those clothes.
##The Donation Feature:
A map and list that shows nearby donation centers and recycling centers. It shows the name of the location and how far away it is in miles.

## The Hanger/NFC:
A hanger which houses an NFC (Near Field Communicator), which you can scan with your phone by going to the scan feature in the app. It will be a tap scan, and once scanned you will put the clothing information and it will be added to your Garment Tracking System. From now on, scanning the hanger will add onto a counter on the clothes connected to that hanger. The hanger will also have a unique id imprinted on it in case the user forgets which clothing corresponds with which hanger.



This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

### Now what?
